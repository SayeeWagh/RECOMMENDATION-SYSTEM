##DESCRIPTION

The objective of this task is to understand and implement a basic recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. Recommendation systems are widely used in real-world applications such as movie streaming platforms, online shopping websites, and music applications to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and past behavior.

In this task, a movie rating dataset is used, where users have rated different movies on a numerical scale. The dataset contains information such as user IDs, movie IDs, and the ratings given by users. This data is first loaded into a Jupyter Notebook environment and processed using Python libraries like pandas and NumPy to make it suitable for analysis.

A collaborative filtering approach is applied to build the recommendation system. Specifically, item-based collaborative filtering is used, where recommendations are generated by finding similarities between items (movies) rather than users. A user–item matrix is created from the dataset, representing ratings given by users to movies. Missing ratings are handled appropriately, and cosine similarity is used to calculate how similar one movie is to another based on user ratings.

Using the computed similarity scores, the system predicts which movies a user is likely to prefer and recommends a list of movies that the user has not rated yet. These recommendations are generated based on the similarity of unseen movies to those already rated by the user.

To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The predicted ratings are compared with actual ratings using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This helps measure how accurately the system predicts user preferences.

Overall, this task provides hands-on experience in building a simple yet effective recommendation system and helps in understanding how collaborative filtering works in real-world applications. The final output is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data loading, model implementation, recommendation results, and evaluation metrics.
